I daily look bcentral.cl to view the CLP price of one dollar (useful to buy outside of my contry), then, bored to open the web to view the price I write a script to get it automatically. You get the code on [http://github.com/dubcl/dollar-day](http://github.com/dubcl/dollar-day)

## usage

```code-bash
$ ./dollarday.sh
```

Cheers.
