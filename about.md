**Who I am?**

Hi, I'm Carlos and this is my little corner on the net, I'm from Chile and actually working as System Architect in a known Chilean company.

Linux enthusiast since 2000, I have the luck to make it my job :)

Some years ago I was staff of the official Chilean Debian community, http://www.debianchile.cl.

Someone know me as "dub" when i play [TF2](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) or [CS](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike), now I have no time for games :(

If you want contact me, you can e-mail me to [this address](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01Ql1ghA0qoYwz1p3WlNTJjA==&c=f3uU2wpO9DF8A5ZHdaKWDr0IxHTUKSnW4HFMOy_T0Dg=).
